ML Content is mostly based on LMU Munich's https://slds-lmu.github.io/i2ml/ material.

# Before start of the lectures
Brash up you Math knowledge, we recommend the following resources:
- Linear Algebra https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra
- Calculus https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/calculus
- Probability https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/probability (you can skip first 4 videos at first)
- Statistics https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNM_Y-bUAhblSAdWRnmBUcr

The videos mostly help to get geometric intuition of the concepts. Especially the ones
by 3blue1brown. Having the intuition will help you a lot when we start covering the concepts.

Here is a collection of resources on wide range of topics that may help as well:
